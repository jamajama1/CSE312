How to run & test software:

*IMPORTANT* I had to hard code in the file path of my html, css, and image (it was the only way, 
using python3). You will need to change the path in order to run it properly. 

In order to run my program, you must use a python ide. Run the program tcp.py using python3.7 or newer 
and go to your browser and type the following the url "http://localhost:8000". You will notice that it will 
have a message welcoming the new user which includes html, css, and image from server. If you refresh the page, you will see that it changes to welcome back 
the recent user which demonstrates the completion of objective 1, 2, 3. If you type the following url 
with the query "http://localhost:8000/?q=jama+jama", you will be redirected to a plain page with message 
"Hello Jama, I'm responding to your query" which demonstrates the completion of objective 4.
